# Part 1. T-tests

We use t-tests to compare means between 2 dif groups.

Mass comparison: male & female chinstrap penguins

```{r}
chinstraps <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Chinstrap")

# Histograms
ggplot(data = chinstraps, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10) +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

#QQ plot (compares our sample to data if it were drawn from a perfectly normally distributed data set)

ggplot(data = chinstraps, aes(sample = body_mass_g))+
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

# Get descriptive statistics

chinstraps %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g),
    median_mass = median(body_mass_g),
    sd_mass = sd(body_mass_g),
    sample_size = n())
```
